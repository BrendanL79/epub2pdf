epub2pdf v0.5 - 15 May 2010 - Copyright 2010 Brendan C. LeFebvre.

See LICENSE DETAILS below for full license and warranty information.


OVERVIEW

epub2pdf is a command-line tool that quickly generates PDF files 
from EPUB ebooks. It allows the user to specify page size, fonts, 
margins, and default paragraph alignment.

The motivation for this program was my purchase of the 
Foxit eSlick e-reader device. For the first year or so 
of its existence on the market, it only supported PDF 
and plain-text files.

I began writing this software so I could comfortably read 
more of my ebook collection on the device.

As a courtesy to fellow eSlick users, the margin and page-size
defaults are optimized for that device.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Tested on Windows Vista and Fedora Linux. Will
theoretically work on any platform for which
Java 6 is available.

The Java Runtime Environment, version 6 or later,
must be installed. Retrieve it at (http://www.java.com/).

The "java" or "java.exe" binary must be in your path,
which is usually done for you with JRE installation.


QUICK START

Unzip the epub2pdf zipfile in a location of your choice. 
It will create a directory called "epub2pdf".

Open a command prompt, change to the new "epub2pdf" directory, 
and invoke the program like so:

(Windows) 
epub2pdf.bat <path-to-epub-file>

(Linux / OSX / etc.)
chmod +x ./epub2pdf.sh 
./epub2pdf.sh <path-to-epub-file>

By default, the PDF is formatted for the Foxit eSlick Reader 
and is placed in your home directory.


CONFIGURATION

Output behavior is controlled by the simple properties file 
"epub2pdf.properties" in the main "epub2pdf" directory. 
You can control margins, page size, default fonts, and output
directory. Comments in the file explain the syntax.

Windows users: use FORWARD SLASHES (/) when specifying the 
output directory, or Java will choke.


CHANGES

Since v0.4:

- Fixed incorrect cancellation of bold/italic modes in some cases.

- Fixed failure to handle trailing spaces in epub2pdf.properties.

- Console output is now prettier and more compact.

- Improved alignment of full-page images.

- Batch processing now continues after a failure.

- Fixed a crash that occurred when converting some older EPUBs.



Since v0.3:

- PDF bookmark list now replicates any nesting in the EPUB's
NCX table of contents.



Since v0.2:

- Fixed an issue with "sticky formatting", where bold or italic 
text specified by an inline tag would persist for the remainder 
of the enclosing block element.

- Fixed an issue that triggered extra paragraph breaks at some 
inline tags.

- Images now appear at the exact place they are declared, rather 
than being postponed when they do not fit on the page. (If the 
image is too large to fit on the remainder of the page, a new 
page is created first.)

- A new page is created in the PDF when the parser encounters 
a file or element specified in the NCX.

- CSS parser can now handle numeric specification of font-weight 
(>=700 bold, else normal).

- Correct version number now appears in console at program start.

- Various minor improvements to source code organization and 
cosmetics.



Since v0.1:

- ePub table of contents now appears as a bookmark list in the
finished PDF. There is no nesting (yet) but all TOC elements 
should appear.

- International characters now render correctly *as long as*
you are using a TrueType font with the necessary glyphs. 
The default Adobe fonts that ship with the iText library will
not work. Copy the .TTF/.TTC file(s) for your desired fonts into 
epub2pdf/lib/fonts, then update the default.font property in
epub2pdf.properties with the human-readable name of your font
(e.g. "calibri", "garamond", etc.)

- Numerous minor bugfixes.


KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS

All of the following issues are slated for resolution in
future releases.

- CSS support is limited to detecting bold and italic modes.
On the other hand, even this meagre capability is more CSS
than Foxit's EPUB renderer can handle, so it is hard for me 
to be too ashamed of this one.

- Having said that... bold/italic text sometimes has an extra 
space at either end.


CONTACT

General inquiries / suggestions: <info@epub2pdf.com>

Report problems to <bugs@epub2pdf.com>. If possible and relevant,
attach the epub and pdf in question, and the full text 
of any error messages. At this early stage I am particularly
keen to stamp out any remaining "showstopper" bugs that cause
the PDF creation process to fail entirely.
